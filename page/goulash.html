    <h2>Goulash</h2>

    <p>If you’re going to try goulash, it should be this recipe. It’s the Hungarian national dish, after all!<br><br>

        It may seem like nothing more than a stew, but it is so full of flavor and makes a beautiful change to boring
        old tomato or chicken noodle.<br><br>

        The ingredients are frugal and filling, using peppers, onions, carrots, and diced beef. Again, Hungarian paprika
        is the key to this soup’s success.</p>
